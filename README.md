Browser extensions and local server to help enable cross browser exploratory testing. Click a button or link in one browser and it's reflected in any other browsers with the plugin enabled.  

Right now, this is really just a proof of concept that I'l try to develop furthur. Currently it works with just regular http sites and clicks. Ideally, text input and https sites will be implemented next.  

###Current Plugins:  

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari

###Requirements:

- Node.js

###Running the Server:

- Clone the repository and navigate into the Server folder
- Verify you have Node.js installed by running ```node --version```
- Run ```npm install```
- Run ```node app.js```
